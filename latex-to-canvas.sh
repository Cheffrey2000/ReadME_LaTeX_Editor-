"""
This script is designed to take a folder of local repositories and a lesson number, and a LaTeX indicator character.
It will then:
    -iterate through each repo
    -checkout the canvas branch
    -fix the LaTeX rendering in the README.md
    -and create a lesson on canvas with the provided course number
Example: bash latex-to-canvas.sh phase2-repos 343  - this will use the post-grad folder and pass 154 as the course id
Requires github-to-canvas gem
